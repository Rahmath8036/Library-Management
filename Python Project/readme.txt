#student ID F211372

My program runs and works for almost every scenario I can think of. For my menu, I have tried to use Tkinter and it does the job for the rest in the python shell. It can search for a book, checkout a book, return a book and select books for a purchase order. To search a book after using the Title, you must look at the output record and enter the book ID to check for the loan availability. My book checkout functionality has a sub menu, to help the librarian handle all the different possible cases when checking a book out. While returning a book, after the successful return, it displays a message about the upcoming reservations for the particular book ID. The graph produced to select a book, provides a budget for each genre based on the popularity accoridng to a ratio calculated. I have also compiled all the testing functions and they work as expected. My program has been structured for convenience and usability. After I put my heart and soul to this, I am really very proud of my self to push through all the tough times and come up with a program that does the needful with no spotted bugs right now and meets the specification. This being my first ever interaction with python, it has has been a tremendous journey of knowing nothing to learning so much. As much as I am excited/ terrified to turn this coursework in, I hope you are happy with my program. Over to you!
